A game Created by using Java Script and Canvas
It wasn't a simple assignment for the person who never programmed in JS before and didn't know about supportive tools like bootstrap.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
Use boothstrap to smoothly move character, create shop and extra objects like shield, bandages etc.

            <p>The credits are the resources which I used to develop my game.</p>
            <p>I used the skeleton given by Edel Sherratt, but I change the code, so I have taken
            the idea and structure. It was really helpful for me to complete the game.</p>
            <p>All CSS files are designed by me and main.cc, login.css are the files from my previous
            assignment for CS22310 HCI module.</p>
